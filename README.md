# Tone of Text ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’¬ðŸ˜¡

Interpreting the tone of a text message or comment can be challenging, as it's often difficult to discern the underlying sentiment behind the words. That's where my bot comes in. By using advanced OpenAI technology, this bot is able to analyze any comment or text input to determine whether the underlying sentiment is negative or positive.
